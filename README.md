For Hack NA's theme of "Engaging Communities," we decided to make catchR -- an AI powered computer vision tool for large-gun recognition in videos. As school shootings increase in number day by day with 22 shootings in 2023 alone, communities and families are distraught. With catchR, we hope to help save communities by limiting the potential consequences of shootings (or prevent them outright). Attached, we have the code for our website made with HTML, CSS, and JS. Apart from that is the code for our Python-based AI coupled with a video to demonstrate catchR.
To use catchR, you must download the folder with the video and the python code and run it through your terminal (not the most user-friendly, we know :|). Then, you will see a slide show of displayed guns and catchR's ability to catch the guns. To edit what video is displayed, you must enter a new video in the same directory and edit the code on line.
